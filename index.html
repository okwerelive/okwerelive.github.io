        <p>Davey Prince is an artist who refuses to be confined. A storyteller first, he weaves melody and lyricism into something larger than genre—a canvas where every word, every note, carries weight. Whether through raw confession or sharpened intensity, his music lives in the tension between vulnerability and defiance, beauty and chaos. Every line is deliberate, every emotion earned, every song a world of its own. For Davey, art isn’t about fitting in—it’s about saying what needs to be said, in whatever way it demands to be heard.</p>
